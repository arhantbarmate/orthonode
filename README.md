## 🛰️ Overview
Orthonode™ is a specialized R&D lab solving the **Oracle Problem** for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) and automated logistics. We develop the **Orthonode Assurance Platform (OAP)**, a deterministic verification layer that distinguishes between simulated telemetry and physical reality.

By cross-referencing GPS traces against raw kinematic constraints and accelerometer noise floors, we ensure that physical work performed matches digital rewards.

## 🛠️ Core Technology Stack
* **OAP (Orthonode Assurance Platform):** Our primary production module for physics-based telemetry validation.
* **Nexus Protocol:** An experimental research prototype focused on decoupling hardware verification from cloud dependencies via Zero-Trust tunnels.
* **Kinematic Attestation:** Deterministic analysis of speed, curvature, and lateral G-force to identify non-physical telemetry patterns.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* **`index.html`**: The main terminal gateway and console.
* **`terms.html`**: Service terms, including read-only audit scope and liability protections.
* **`privacy.html`**: Data sovereignty policy, outlining our "Analyze & Purge" ephemeral processing lifecycle.
* **`404.html`**: Custom system-halt error page.
* **`robots.txt` / `sitemap.xml`**: Search engine directives optimized for our stealth-lab posture.

## ⚖️ Rebranding & Identity Note
**Orthonode Infrastructure Labs** was established following a strategic rebranding of the infrastructure division of **Coreframe Systems** to resolve regional naming conflicts and trademark issues. This repository serves as the official and singular home for all OAP operations and Nexus Protocol research.
