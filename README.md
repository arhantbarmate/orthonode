## 🛰️ Overview
Orthonode™ is a specialized R&D lab solving the **Oracle Problem** for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) and automated logistics. We develop the **Orthonode Assurance Platform (OAP)**, a deterministic verification layer that distinguishes between simulated telemetry and physical reality.

By cross-referencing GPS traces against raw kinematic constraints and accelerometer noise floors, we ensure that physical work performed matches digital rewards.

## 🛠️ Core Technology Stack
* **OAP (Production):** Our primary auditing module (v2.5.0) for physics-based telemetry validation.
* **Nexus Protocol (Research Phase):** A hardened research prototype (v1.4.0) focused on decoupling hardware verification from cloud dependencies. It remains under the active jurisdiction of Orthonode Labs as our foundational hardware-truth layer.
* **Kinematic Attestation:** Deterministic analysis of speed, curvature, and lateral G-force to identify non-physical telemetry patterns.

## ⚖️ Rebranding & Identity Note
**Orthonode Infrastructure Labs** was established following a strategic rebranding of **Coreframe Systems**. This repository is the official and singular home for all OAP production and Nexus Protocol research. All intellectual property associated with Nexus Protocol v1.4.0 has been legally migrated to Orthonode jurisdiction.
